My javascript file, Search.JS is resusable. It can be inserted into any web application and take in a search query and search in the database. The only part that needs tweeking is the JSON because there is some customized URL encoding there, such as the a href link in addition to the hash links for the webpages. Overall, it is incredibly reusable. It could be used to search for queries in a library like the title of books and its contents, or perhaps go over song lyrics and titles and artists online.
