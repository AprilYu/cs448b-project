There are many parts of my solution that are reusable. They include:

1: The search box and real time update.

2: BLEHA

Some situations in which these solutions can be used include: Searching anything, such as Google or Ask.FM. This can be also used in searching for music in a database and displaying the names of the artists or song in the box while typing in text.
